# icelineDocRender
Port of my ancient doc renderer into PHP5.6 &amp;&amp; Symfony2  

Objectives
* PHP code that people may see (being BE, you can't legally see most of what I did at other companies) 
* Add caching layer for pages
* Get performance benefits from using newer PHP & a better framework.  Get more features from Symfony 
* Be able to use things like DI as its now possible 
* 

* (q) why do I have iceline in the name twice? it looks silly.
*     (a) the first renderer was called 'iceline', its the iceline file format document renderer.
* (q) do you have something against DB?
*     (a) my current use case doesn't have concurrent edits, so a DBMS is unneeded.  NB, It wouldn't be much effort to map ResourceHash->setContentFromFile to a MongoDB document read 
*

# Dependancies
* Symfony (Will update this)
* text_wiki https://packagist.org/packages/mrcore/text_wiki
