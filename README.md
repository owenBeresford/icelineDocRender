# icelineDocRender
Port of my ancient doc renderer into PHP5.6 &amp;&amp; Symfony2  

Objectives
* PHP code that people may see (being BE, you can't legally see most of what I did at other companies) 
* Add caching layer for pages
* Get performance benefits from using newer PHP & a better framework.  Get more features from Symfony 
* Be able to use things like DI as its now possible 
* .
* (q) why do I have iceline in the name twice? it looks silly.
*     (a) the first renderer was called 'iceline', its the iceline file format document renderer.
* (q) Do I have something against twig?
*     (a) No, but its designed for HTML, not text.  Iceline is for large articles of text.  If someone wants to port my >200 article into twig they may (open commons licence), but I think this is faster/ less BORING/ more useful side effects 
* (q) Do you have something against DB?
*     (a) my current use case doesn't have concurrent edits, so a DBMS is unneeded.  NB, It wouldn't be much effort to map ResourceHash->setContentFromFile to a MongoDB document read 
*
